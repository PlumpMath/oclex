OCLEx
=====

OCLEx is a collection of examples of how to set up and use OpenCL using Java and the LWJGL library.


Examples and experiments included so far:

1. Repulsive particles - One of the simplest demos, showing the bare minimum of setup required in order to get something nice out of OpenCL. More precisely, the experiment implements a bunch of particles which repel and attract each other and have a mesmerising motion if left to run for a longer time.
2. Stochastic optimization - This is a more practical example showing how kernels run in parallel to find the maximum value of a function, through a stochastic optimization method (a variant of the hill-climbing algorithm).
3. Simplified Particle Swarm Optimization  - Implementation of the PSO algorithm and a tiny visualisation tool of the function and partial solutions.
4. Shadows - Simple algorithm for casting shadows.
5. Simple image manipulation - This example shows the bare minimum setup required for loading images, applying transformations and retrieving them.
